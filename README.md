# MY HOUSE <3

## Yo, what is this, 4e chenhou??

this is my own custom arch setup (aka. rice), feel free to explore yourself in the code <3
i spend big time writing and configuring stuff, u think im gon let it ez for u to have such? haha u kiddin xd
there are some cool projects hidden there.. ENJOY EXPLORING, i hope u learn somth and use it for good <3

## stuff I did here I think nobody has:
- separate shell history files switcher
- e4kar loop
- the custom dynamic terminal title'ing
- clipboards editor on vim keybinding, direcly saves modification to clipboard (but there's an issue here, vim does things that its untold to do (metrouche), when decoding a base64 and saving it, a weird thing happen, ig its about encoding..)
